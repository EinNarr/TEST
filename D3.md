# Feature of Z3 Solver
 
According to the [IEEE 829](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_test_documentation), the feature is defined as a distinguishing characteristic of a software item (e.g., performance, portability, or functionality). A system is said to be feature-rich when it has many options and functional capabilities available to the user. These feature-rich characteristics also determine the variability of the software system.

The feature of Z3 solver is listed in the following table,

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Compiling | The Z3 can be compiled in Visual Studio and Makefile |
| API | The Z3 offers bindings for .NET, C, C++, JAVA, OCaml and Python |
| OS  | Operating system where the Z3 will run, including Windows, OSX, Linux(Ubuntu, Debian), FreeBSD     |
|  Environment   |  User can use Z3 online, or locally(download IDE or compiled from source code)     |
|                    Theory         |        Theory the SMT solver can solve                                                    |
|    Input formats   | Simplify, SMT-LIB, Z3, Dimacs are accepted     |
|   Model generation  |   Generated model in terms of your own satisfiability can be subsequently invoked again to cater new problem |
| Number type  | Floating point number and fixed point number is allowed in Z3. The latter one need [µZ](http://rise4fun.com/Z3/tutorial/fixedpoints) as an extension|
| Strategies| The user can combine their own new algorithm to solve the new problem with Z3|
| Expression| Z3 support strings, sequences and regular expressions under constraints|


Z3 solver is a software facing the SMT problem which makes it particularly feature-riched in the theory it supports. From the standing point of the users, the amounts and soliving efficiency for supported theory determines the quality of the SMT solver. For Z3 SMT 2.0, theories including the **propositional logic, uninterpreted function and constants, linear real and integer arithmetic, bitvectors, arrays, datatypes, quantifiers** are supported. These mentioned theories can be regarded as the transformation from the SAT problem with the definite background. Therefore, these theories can satisfy the usage requirement of users, especially software engineers from different domain. For example, the engineer who is responsible for the data structures processing might be interested in the bitvector theory solving approach, like (**w**[31:0])>>16!=O16:**w**[31:16]

Starting from a user's perspective, the 1st variation comes with the selection using Z3 online or local. When using Z3 there is no variability among the OS being used. However if Z3 is run locally, the user has to choose whether to use the pre-built binary version, optionally with an external IDE, or build by himself. Z3 can be built with Visual Stdio or a Makefile. However Visual Stido is incompatible on Linux or OSX. What is more, the external IDE does not support any x64 Operation System.

Though Z3 itselft is mainly coded in C++, it provides multiple APIs in different programming language in the directory `src/api/` for a broader audience. For example, it provide a header file namely `z3++.h` for C++ users, also they provide a package namely `com.microsoft.z3` for Java users. When using the online version of Z3, the user can only use the praser supported by that website, for example, [Z3 at rise4fun](http://rise4fun.com/z3/) only supports [SMT-LIB 2.0 standard](http://www.smtlib.org/). When running locally, the user can usually have a broader choice in input format. Z3 understands a set of default file extensions and calls the right praser in directory `src/parsers/` to praser it.

## Binding time

According to [Programming Syntax & Semantics](http://www.vietspring.org/java/notes/binding.pdf), "Binding time is the time at which a binding takes place". Besides, a binding is static if it first occurs before run time and remains unchanged throughout program execution, and a binding is dynamic if it first occurs during execution or can change during execution of the program.

Among all features listed above, some are bound through development of the product, some are decided by users before using the product, and some are chosen by users when using the product.

### Through development

As we all know, Z3 is a theory prover. Theories Z3 can prove/solve are decided through development of this product by developers. Every time Z3 was released, possible theories are already bound with the product and cannot be changed after release.

### Before using

Before use of the product, firstly, user chooses which OS he is willing to use and bind this feature with the product.

Secondly, user should choose an environment to either use Z3 online (on a website) or locally (download IDE or compile from source code).

If locally use of the product is chosen, user also needs to choose a compiling method. He can either use a Makefile or use Visual Studio to have the source code compiled. Also, an API should be selected to choose the realization format of the product. After compiling method and language (API) are chosen, these features are bound with the product.


### When using

When using the product, user firstly chooses input format and type of numbers to write a theory or formula. After these are chosen, expressions and strategies can also be chosen by user.

When user is doing a prove of a theory, or solving a formula, he can not only test if a theory is satisfiable, but also choose to have or not have a satisfiable model generated.

#Implementation Strategy
Z3 uses several implementation strategies to provide variability for OS, API and multiple theories support. We categorize these
strategies into 3 areas, namely design patterns, conditional statements and configurations.

###Design pattern
Design patterns offer general solutions to reoccurring design problems. Implementing variabiity is a reoccuring problem.
[script/mk_util.py](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/blob/master/scripts/mk_util.py) is the main souce code to enable variability for 
various platforms and APIs. It adopts the so-called ['template-method pattern'](http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-37521-7).
Implementations of this pattern are straightforward in Python: it implements the algorithm skeleton as several methods in an abstract class.
Subsequently, a subclass extends the abstract class and provides custom behavior. Different subclasses can provide different specific behaviors,
but all share the overall implementation skeleton of the algorithm. [script/mk_util.py](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/blob/master/scripts/mk_util.py)
first defines an abstract class `Component` for basic setups, such as name, path and dependencies. Subsequently, `LibComponent`, `ExeComponent`, `DDLComponent`,
`PythonInstallComponent`, `DotNetDLLComponent`, `JavaDLLComponent`, `MLComponent` and `ExampleComponent` all take `Example` as a parameter
for basic setups and meanwhile modify and/or adding individual configurations. `ExampleComponent` again is used as a parameter for its sub-classes to provide
variability for different API examples, namely `CppExampleComponent`, `DotNetExampleComponent`, `JavaExampleComponent`, `MLExampleComponent` and `PythonExampleComponent`.
These sub-classes share similar implementation skeleton of the algorithm, but with distinguished compilers, src_files, and makefile configurations.

###Conditiaonal statements
Conditional statements are used at both run-time and build-time to provide variability for OS and API support. At build-time, users can use options (e.g. --python or --java) in command line to allow bindings for different languages. A function parse_option()
will be called to implement this configuration. See this snippet for example,
```
  elif opt in ('-.net', '--dotnet'):
     DOTNET_ENABLED = True
  elif opt in ('-j', '--java'):
     JAVA_ENABLED = True
  elif opt in ('--python'):
     PYTHON_INSTALL_ENABLED = True
```
At run-time, function `mk_configure()` in [script/mk_util.py](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/blob/master/scripts/mk_util.py) also provides
conditional statements to match different platforms, for example:
```
if sysname == 'Darwin':
            SO_EXT    = '.dylib'
            SLIBFLAGS = '-dynamiclib'
        elif sysname == 'Linux':
            CXXFLAGS       = '%s -fno-strict-aliasing -D_LINUX_' % CXXFLAGS
            OS_DEFINES     = '-D_LINUX_'
            SO_EXT         = '.so'
            LDFLAGS        = '%s -lrt' % LDFLAGS
            SLIBFLAGS      = '-shared'
            SLIBEXTRAFLAGS = '%s -lrt' % SLIBEXTRAFLAGS
        elif sysname == 'FreeBSD':
            CXXFLAGS       = '%s -fno-strict-aliasing -D_FREEBSD_' % CXXFLAGS
            OS_DEFINES     = '-D_FREEBSD_'
            SO_EXT         = '.so'
            LDFLAGS        = '%s -lrt' % LDFLAGS
            SLIBFLAGS      = '-shared'
            SLIBEXTRAFLAGS = '%s -lrt' % SLIBEXTRAFLAGS
        elif sysname == 'OpenBSD':
            CXXFLAGS       = '%s -fno-strict-aliasing -D_OPENBSD_' % CXXFLAGS
            OS_DEFINES     = '-D_OPENBSD_'
            SO_EXT         = '.so'
            SLIBFLAGS      = '-shared'
        elif sysname[:6] ==  'CYGWIN':
            CXXFLAGS    = '%s -D_CYGWIN -fno-strict-aliasing' % CXXFLAGS
            OS_DEFINES     = '-D_CYGWIN'
            SO_EXT      = '.dll'
            SLIBFLAGS   = '-shared'
  ```

###Configuration files
[scripts/mk_project.py](https://github.com/delftswa2016/z3/blob/master/scripts/mk_project.py) combines all configuration files, including
lib, exe, API_files ('z3_api.h', 'z3_ast_containers.h', 'z3_algebraic.h', 'z3_polynomial.h', 'z3_rcf.h', 'z3_fixedpoint.h', 'z3_optimization.h', 'z3_interp.h', 'z3_fpa.h'),
api_dll and api_example. Z3 allows for external API additions by using the python "macros": def_Type() and def_API().
New types and function definitions can be added to the Z3 API. The .h files provided to `mk_bindings(API_files)` contain these definitions.
See [src\api\z3_api.h](https://github.com/delftswa2016/z3/blob/master/src/api/z3_api.h) for many examples.

The evolution for the variability can be identified via pull request. For example, in pull request [#459](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/pull/459), [Dan Liew](https://github.com/delcypher) try to come up with a new feature to build the system, namely CMake. He holds the reason that CMake can support for various generators and opens up the possibility of building Z3 with a cross compiler in the future. Futhermore, in the pull request [#461](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/pull/461), Dan Liew perfect his design which gains the main developers support for setting up a new feature for the building approach intead of merging the old style of building directly. While for the issues, it is more about the query about configuring system. In issue #428, the user has trouble in setting up µZ query parsing which tend to be the discrepancy of the tutorial version.
