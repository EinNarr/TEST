- Attended lectures.
- Selected project.
- Reviewed programming language(C++).
- Read chapters on DESOSA.
- Read book R&W.

### Week 2

All of us were working on deliverable 1 this week. Details of what we've done in this week are as follows.

- Attended lectures.
- Read book R&W Chapter 9 and 16, which are introduction of stakeholders and context view respectively.
- Divided the work.
- Hongjia Wu mainly wrote the introduction of the product and did context view analysis of the system
- Yujing Gong, Qiaoqiao Li and Bohao Zhang mainly did stakeholder analysis, Issue analysis and PR analysis. 
- Based on the above analyses, integrators of the system are identified and analyzed mainly by Yujing Gong.

### Week 3

### Week 4

We spent the fourth week getting familiar with the variability perspectives. Things we did in the fourth week are as follows:

- Hongjia Wu gives each feature a name, and describes key characteristics and analyze the evolution history of the variability mechanism, and of configurable features. Identify issues and pull request that relate to the configurability of the system you study.   
- Bohao Zhang identifies the relationship beetween the features and visualize them through FeatureIDE.    
- Yujing Gong identifies the binding time of the features.   
- Qiaoqiao Li identifies the strategy used to realize/implement the desired variability/configurability.
